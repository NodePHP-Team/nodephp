Javascript Interfaces


Javascript interfaces add functionality not normally available in javascript. They are commonly used with WebApps on Android. You can pass functionality that is 
usually restricted within the constraints of Javascript. This usually applies to web browser javascript engines. This system is purely a javascript transpiler that converts and
executes the javascript in the PHP compiler. This can however be adapted to be used in a PHP based browser used for scraping.
