# nodephp
A Javascript Engine for PHP. Execute javascript, like never before in PHP. This can also be extended to use alongside scrapers. 

# notice
Asynchronous functionality that usually comes with Javascript isn't available on PHP as is single thread, this library pre processes the entire eval'd code, then executes it accordingly.
